# Welcome to the Blog

Awhile back I started a blog, but the path I chose caused a lot of friction from the idea creating to the publishing. Hopefully this one is setup better where I can update things here with minimal effort in the publishing phase.

  

Hopefully over the next couple of weeks I can work on converting my older posts to this version so I can create a nice backlog.
