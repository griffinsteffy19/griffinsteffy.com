In 2024 our family took a mindset shift to self-sufficiency. I have always had a urge to be independent and not rely on others for the things I need.  You'll find this theme throughout many of the projects I pursue. Naturally, food was the primary first target, as it is a necessity to living. We actually began with some sourdough after a friend showed my wife how to make it, but in the back of our minds we always wanted chickens. This is where our Homesteading journey began.
