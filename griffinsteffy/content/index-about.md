# Hello, I'm Griffin

Welcome to my personal corner of the internet! This isn't my first attempt a personal blog/website, but or this attempt I have set it up to hopefully have the minimum amount of friction from idea creation to publishing.

The goal for this website is to share my thoughts, projects, and ideas. I have a passion for fitness, programming, homesteading, and photography (quite the range...I know).

## What You'll Find Here

- **[Blog](/posts)**: Exploring ideas, sharing insights, and documenting my journey
- **[Projects](/projects)**: A showcase of my technical and creative work
- **Gallery**: *coming soon*
