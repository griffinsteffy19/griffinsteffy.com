My prediction was that I would be elated to move into my families first home together, and even though there would be challenges I would be so happy to be there that I would not let those challenges phase me. I still had those elated feelings, sometimes I still feel like my life isn&amp;rsquo;t real, but I seemed to be more sunk into reality that I know have a lot more responsibility than I have ever had before.
I did not prepare myself for the emotional toll that these new responsibilities would weigh on my mind. Since we have moved in I feel like my creativity has been at an all time low since starting this project. I find my self coming up wit titles, but nothing more ever comes from those ideas zipping past me. On top of that, we haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to make many changes to the place, because we are just trying to figure it out as we go, so we have yet to put our stamp on the place.
I can go on and on about how I feel like I am now on the way up mentally from this home purchasing experience, but what started it all was beginning to make our home feel like it is ours. We have been holding back on making and major cosmetic changes for the first month or two to make sure our finances are in order. I believe that regardless of what stress I have now, adding some financial stress on top of it cannot make it better. Knowing that, we still decided that it was time to paint (we might have been pushed a little after we discovered that there was a 40% off sale). Paint seemed like one of the least expensive changes we could make, and we want to do it anyway so no long term loss if it didn&amp;rsquo;t make a difference.
After painting our bedroom, I can assure you that I feel much better about sleeping in there at night, purely by how I feel when I walk in the room. I can only describe it as putting our mark on the home, and no longer are we living in someone else&amp;rsquo;s space. All it took was a few gallons of paint, and for us to borrow some paint supplies from our family to turn things around. We didn&amp;rsquo;t eliminate any problems, all we did was give the walls a facelift and it has kicked us off in the right direction.
All of a sudden I can feel my creative flow coming back, and am more motivated to keep pressing towards my goals that I have laid out before. This experience has me thinking, I wonder what other small changes I can make in other areas of my life that could have a larger impact than what they would cost me. Often it is the smallest changes that make the biggest difference.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The State of My Second Brain</title><link>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/the-state-of-my-second-brain/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/the-state-of-my-second-brain/</guid><description>&lt;p>I first discovered the concept of a second brain in the late spring, as I was in the middle of organizing my life. I was dealing with files, tasks, events, and projects that I was thinking about starting. To be honest I wasn’t that disorganized beforehand, but what I was looking for was a structure to follow when new projects or ideas come up. I found that when a new idea would pop in my head, I scrambled to find the best place to at least record that idea.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Core Principal of Finance</title><link>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/the-core-principal-of-finance/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/the-core-principal-of-finance/</guid><description>&lt;p>My Financial knowledge is by no means elite, but the growth I have experienced over the past 3-5 years is tremendous. Even with an engineering degree from a prestigious school, I still was a financial novice (regardless of what I thought of myself at the time).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since graduating in 2019, I have gained various life experiences that have aided my financial knowledge, in much greater steps than any engineering class could have provided. My journey started off by paying off student loans, read &lt;a href="4%20Notes/Blog%20Posts/A%20Ton%20of%20Bricks%20(FP,%20pt%201).md">A Ton of Bricks (FP, pt.1)&lt;/a> if you want to hear more about how that store begins. Following our journey to financial peace, I dove deep into the world of investing which is where I discovered Rule #1 Investing, a methodology hosted by Phil Town, but based off the principals taught by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. While learning more about Rule #1, I also began to do more research about what it meant to save, and how to better utilize a budget, besides tracking monthly transactions. This is the point I tied it all together.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Investing Alfred Workflow v1</title><link>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/investing-alfred-workflow-v1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/investing-alfred-workflow-v1/</guid><description>&lt;p>After I got my first personal apple computer, I quickly found out about the productivity tool &lt;a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred&lt;/a>. At first I thought it was just a slightly faster spotlight, but after trying to use it as my main source of navigating my computer I realized the benefits of what this tool can provide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the main activities I do on my computer is do investing research. Typically this is looking at financial statements, or browsing through other articles for a company. One site that I frequent the most is the Rule One Toolbox. I found that the time it was taking me to navigate to a specific ticker from whatever other app I was using was consuming more time than I would like. I then set out to create an Alfred workflow that would speed up searching on the toolbox.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Right Opportunity</title><link>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/the-right-opportunity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/the-right-opportunity/</guid><description>&lt;p>Our Family just recently got an accepted offer on a house, and we are every excited to move into that next phase of life. Owning some property is something that we have had in the back of our minds since we have been married. Even though we have enjoyed the renting phase as we go through various life transitions, there have been countless times where we wish we just owned the place where we lived. This is not a knock on renting, certain lifestyles, and life situations definitely cater more to the renter. We were traveling a lot for work, growing our family, moving states, and changing jobs; no way could we have been taking care of a homestead in the midst of all of those life changes. Renting has provided us flexibility, and the ability to wait for the right opportunity to move into home ownership.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quiet Strength by Tony Dungy</title><link>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/quiet-strength-by-tony-dungy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/quiet-strength-by-tony-dungy/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="what-are-recaps">What are Recaps?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Recaps are not reviews, but more of a way to translate my notes I take while reading/watching/listening to content into planned out thoughts. Don’t expect me to give you a star rating, or a sparknotes style review that allows you to not read the book. These are just thoughts I had, interesting points, and overall themes that I noticed throughout content consumption.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="family-is-everything">Family is Everything&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If there is one thing I picked up from reading Tony Dungy’s first book, it is that family is everything. Of course the whole book has football related references, stories of his time in the NFL, and many other great snippets of life advice, but overall what I have in big letters in my notebook is “Family is Everything.” There is no other group of people that know you better than your family. Family does not have to be blood related, and a better word for it might be something cheesy like “circle of trust”. Regardless, I consider family to be those who love you the most, and who you love the most. Everyone has a different shape that surrounds who they’d call “family,” but cherishing time with them is something that I need to constantly remind myself. It can be easy to isolate myself, because I know what I like the best, but if God wanted us to live alone, I don’t think Eve would have ever joined Adam in the garden of Eden.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I've Read the Bible 838 Times</title><link>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/ive-read-the-bible-838-times/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/ive-read-the-bible-838-times/</guid><description>&lt;p>On January 1st, 2020 I set a goal in my mind to read the entire Bible that year. My goal was to read a piece of it every day, and by the end of the year, I will have read the entire book cover to cover (essentially).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a few days I rediscovered the &lt;a href="https://oneyearbibleonline.com">The One Year Bible&lt;/a>, which provided more of a structure to my reading plan. This allowed me to offload the mental process of deciding how much I should read that day, and just focus on reading. The obvious benefit here was saving time, but it also allowed me to focus more on the content and not constantly looking for my next stopping point as I read. 838 Days in and I am by no means an expert on the Bible, I have just read through it a few times, but since starting this habit I have learned 3 key lessons…&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Semi-Rural Home Internet</title><link>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/semi-rural-home-internet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/semi-rural-home-internet/</guid><description>&lt;p>My family recently ended our time living in an apartment and found a home in a semi-rural area. I say semi-rural because we are surrounded by cornfields and country homes, but are 3 minutes from a business park, and 3 minutes form three different interstate exits. Unfortunately, even with the business development happening near out home, the residential infrastructure has not kept up. I work in the tech space, and to be short I am a power user of our home internet service. Whether it is video calls for work, streaming high quality videos, or other personal projects (this site included); I am constantly uploading and downloading from a server somewhere.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Test Full Pipeline Post</title><link>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/testing-again/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/testing-again/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="test-header">Test Header&lt;/h1>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>I was very naive as a college graduate when it came to my finances. I generally knew how to save money, be frugal with my spending, but my actual my applicable knowledge of finances was novice at best. Having just graduated from a prestigious engineer school, I had accepted my first real job, was moving to another state, and was prepping to get married that summer, life was great. It wasn’t that I didn’t know what was coming my way, I just did not understand the gap of knowledge that I had to make up. The good news was that I had time on my side to figure things out before they really became a problem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First YouTube Video</title><link>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/first-youtube-video/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/first-youtube-video/</guid><description>&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;p>If there is one thing you should know about me is that I am not a confident writer. As I wrote papers during school, I tended to procrastinate (maybe like yourself). However, I’m not sure I always waited till the last minute due to a lack of an idea. Sometimes it was no motivation to write, but looking back I do not think that was always the case.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>FFP (Fastest Feasible Product)</title><link>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/ffp-fastest-feasible-product/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/ffp-fastest-feasible-product/</guid><description>&lt;p>The hurdle of perfection is one of the hardest to get over when it comes to starting a project. I wonder how many projects I failed to start, because the ideal ending seemed like too daunting of a task. It sounds easy to take one step at a time, but when the main focus is perfection the road will never end, and taking a small step seems like a drop in the ocean.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
