  <p>After I got my first personal apple computer, I quickly found out about the productivity tool <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alfred</a>. At first I thought it was just a slightly faster spotlight, but after trying to use it as my main source of navigating my computer I realized the benefits of what this tool can provide.</p>
<p>One of the main activities I do on my computer is do investing research. Typically this is looking at financial statements, or browsing through other articles for a company. One site that I frequent the most is the Rule One Toolbox. I found that the time it was taking me to navigate to a specific ticker from whatever other app I was using was consuming more time than I would like. I then set out to create an Alfred workflow that would speed up searching on the toolbox.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with Alfred, you might wonder why I didn’t use the web query feature that comes with the application. In short the reason is that the queries aren’t as simple as they are for other common sites like google.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>TKR: AAPL</p>
<p>RO: <a href="https://ruleonetoolbox.com/ticker/NAS:AAPL/company/brief" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ruleonetoolbox.com/ticker/NAS:AAPL/company/brief</a></p>
<p>In order to query both of these websites, it takes knowledge of their trading exchange, which is easily google-able, but for the 10k possible company tickers, I wanted a more automated way of generating the specific URLs. With those requirements I set out to create a script that would generate a JSON file, as well as a CSV file that I would use to populate the argument suggestions for my workflow. The script pulls info from a file downloaded from the SEC, and then searches Yahoo! Finance using a free python package to get the company name, and exchange.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed after using it a bit, that the exchange reported on Yahoo can sometimes be different than the one used for Rule One. However, this isn’t typical with common companies in the US, so for now I ignored those situations and recorded which ones I didn’t process in case I wanted to refer to them later.</p>
<p>The final challenge I had was actually executing the script to process the ten thousand different tickers. At first I was running it on my local PC, but the downside was that I needed to have an internet connection, and be powered on until it finished. Since I was pulling Yahoo! Finance from a free package, it wasn’t the fastest API integration, so it took up to 10 seconds for some companies. After a few days of trying to keep it running on my local machine, I bit the bullet and bought a remote droplet on Digital Ocean to run the script. Turns out once I figured out how to run it in the background there it was a much easier process to generate the data I needed. I simply committed the final results to my repository, and walla! I was ready to go!</p>
