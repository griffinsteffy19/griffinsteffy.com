  <p>Almost 3 months I gave a comprehensive explanation of [[4 Notes/Blog Posts/The State of My Second Brain]], or personal knowledge management system (PKM). At the time I was using <a href="https://www.notion.so" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notion</a> as the heart of everything, but I quickly ran into some of its limitations shortly after that content went live.</p>
<p>What I found the most frustrating about Notion, was the need for a internet connection to access your entire workspace. This is not new information, it is one of the biggest complaints about the tool, but in my mind I did not think that I would ever run into this, because we live in 2022. I then realized how often I was inside of large auditoriums where I typically like to take notes (ie. Church, conferences, etc.) and there I didn&rsquo;t have connection to view the entire workspace I had built for over a month. Notion does cache recent and frequent pages that you open, but the whole idea of a PKM is that you can access your whole library, not just what you could access in your first brain (recent and frequent).</p>
<p>This frustration lead me on a search again, and this time I looked for something that had similar functionality as Notion, but it didn&rsquo;t have to be quite as powerful and all-encompassing. I like the ability to link notes, provide some simple meta-data but I noticed that with Notion I often spent as much time prepping the meta-data as I did entering the information. I then rediscovered <a href="https://obsidian.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Obsidian</a>. I had actually tried out this tool before committing to Notion the first time, but I did not feel that it was powerful enough at the time to provide the organization I was envisioning.</p>
<p>Obsidian at it&rsquo;s core is a text based tool using the universal formatting known as markdown. I am not the best at markdown, but I had some background in it from my day job so I was lucky to not have to learn the basics, but you can get started <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> on how to get started. Since the tool is almost completely text based it eliminates the distractions I was creating for myself to format the pages, and make them as visual pleasing as possible. The best part is that it is &ldquo;almost&rdquo; all text based. The app has actually been around for quite some time, so there are a ton of community plugins that provide some key functionality like tables, and simple data queries that provide just enough functionality for me to jump all in.</p>
<p>Here are the top X things I enjoy that convinced me to switch to obsidian for the long haul</p>
<ol>
<li>All data is locally accessible on any device with the app
<ul>
<li>sync for me happens through iCloud drive, and since it is all text based I can stay on the base storage plan
<ul>
<li>I currently have it syncing onto my phone, personal mac laptop, iPad, and work windows PC</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tagging is easy
<ul>
<li>tagging can happen anywhere within the file, and not just at the top to be queryable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intuitive keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>Fast, Fast, Fast
<ul>
<li>Mainly because everything is local, files load instantly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Graph View
<ul>
<li>There is definitely a use case for thought linking via graph view, but I just have not used the tool long enough to see those benefits. However it does look cool though
!<img src="/images/graph-view.jpeg" alt="Image Description"></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Community Plug-ins
<ul>
<li>At its core it is no more than a fancy text editor, but with some community plug-ins and the continued updates the developers keep putting Obsidian is a full fledged PKM tool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I cannot promise that I&rsquo;ll use Obsidian forever, however it is the longest I have used a single note taking app consistently. In fact over half of the content I have put up so far has been planned out using Obsidian!</p>
