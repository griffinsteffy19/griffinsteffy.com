  <p>I have never been a heavy user of social media, but I noticed about a month ago that I was starting to spend more time than usual scrolling. Having an iPhone, I actually have had a time limit setup for over a year, but have ignored it almost every time.
After I noticed that my mindless scrolling was starting to take away from doing things that I enjoy, and bring me happiness I decided to just delete all social media from my phone. It helps that I talk to all of my friends in dedicated messaging apps, so I did not lose any meaningful connections of mine by making this change.
Not only was it taking up time I could use better elsewhere, social media has this effect to limit expectations in life. It is great to look up to others, but through the phone screen I end up setting my expectations to what everyone else has accomplished. My work becomes limited by what others have done, and not by what my own mind can create.
I have struggled the last few months to get content up on this website. Even with potentially the lowest barrier to entry for uploading content, I still feel like I am fishing for ideas on a weekly basis. Since making this change it has gotten slightly better, but I&rsquo;m sure that years of limiting my expectations, while also trying to be somewhat creative are two forces fighting against each other.
I don&rsquo;t see myself adding back any of the social media apps anytime soon. They were making too big of an impact on what I want to accomplish, hoping that my creativity begins to flourish without having an established ceiling on top of it.</p>
