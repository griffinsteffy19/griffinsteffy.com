  <p>Even though I switched to obsidian for my second brain, I still value Notion as a tool for organizing information. The true power of notion is in it&rsquo;s database capabilities which is why it is a top choice for a lot of people&rsquo;s second brain.
I still take advantage of Notion&rsquo;s strength by creating a coffee database for all of the different beans and roasters that I have tried for about the last 2 years. This is something I used to do in an Apple Note, but it is much easier to maintain inside of a database.
I started out keeping track of different beans that I tried because someday I was going to forget what beans I had tried, and which ones I hav not. This then expanded into a rough ranking system so if I ever did want to try beans again, then I knew which ones were my favorites, and as time has continued I have kept adding metadata to each entry to provide as much useful information I&rsquo;ll need regarding coffee beans.
