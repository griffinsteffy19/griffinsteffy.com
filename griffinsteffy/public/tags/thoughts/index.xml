&lt;p>If there is one thing you should know about me is that I am not a confident writer. As I wrote papers during school, I tended to procrastinate (maybe like yourself).

Sometimes it was no motivation to write, but looking back I do not think that was always the case.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
