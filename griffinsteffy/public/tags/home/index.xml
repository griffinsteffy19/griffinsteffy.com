What I did enjoy was the scent and vibe that coffee carries with it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to turn into a latte lover though, so I set a requirement for myself that in order to start making coffee on a regular basis I was going to enjoy drinking it black. I did not realize that this requirement I set for myself would then send me down a rabbit hole on how to make great tasting black cups of coffee in the morning versus the typical drip or pod machines. I started the journey using a French Press, moved quickly to an AeroPress for a whole year, and then finally moved to a chemex and have been there ever since. I still enjoy using the other tools, you can make great coffee out of almost anything actually, but I feel like I have settled down to a morning routine that I don&amp;rsquo;t see making drastic changes to for quite some time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Making Small Changes</title><link>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/making-small-changes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/making-small-changes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Buying a house can be simplified to a single transaction of an asset; I never viewed it that way, but my expectations for how I would be emotionally effected were not even close. My prediction was that I would be elated to move into my families first home together, and even though there would be challenges I would be so happy to be there that I would not let those challenges phase me. I still had those elated feelings, sometimes I still feel like my life isn&amp;rsquo;t real, but I seemed to be more sunk into reality that I know have a lot more responsibility than I have ever had before.
I did not prepare myself for the emotional toll that these new responsibilities would weigh on my mind. Since we have moved in I feel like my creativity has been at an all time low since starting this project. I find my self coming up wit titles, but nothing more ever comes from those ideas zipping past me. On top of that, we haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to make many changes to the place, because we are just trying to figure it out as we go, so we have yet to put our stamp on the place.
I can go on and on about how I feel like I am now on the way up mentally from this home purchasing experience, but what started it all was beginning to make our home feel like it is ours. We have been holding back on making and major cosmetic changes for the first month or two to make sure our finances are in order. I believe that regardless of what stress I have now, adding some financial stress on top of it cannot make it better. Knowing that, we still decided that it was time to paint (we might have been pushed a little after we discovered that there was a 40% off sale). Paint seemed like one of the least expensive changes we could make, and we want to do it anyway so no long term loss if it didn&amp;rsquo;t make a difference.
After painting our bedroom, I can assure you that I feel much better about sleeping in there at night, purely by how I feel when I walk in the room. I can only describe it as putting our mark on the home, and no longer are we living in someone else&amp;rsquo;s space. All it took was a few gallons of paint, and for us to borrow some paint supplies from our family to turn things around. We didn&amp;rsquo;t eliminate any problems, all we did was give the walls a facelift and it has kicked us off in the right direction.
All of a sudden I can feel my creative flow coming back, and am more motivated to keep pressing towards my goals that I have laid out before. This experience has me thinking, I wonder what other small changes I can make in other areas of my life that could have a larger impact than what they would cost me. Often it is the smallest changes that make the biggest difference.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Right Opportunity</title><link>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/the-right-opportunity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/the-right-opportunity/</guid><description>&lt;p>Our Family just recently got an accepted offer on a house, and we are every excited to move into that next phase of life. Owning some property is something that we have had in the back of our minds since we have been married. Even though we have enjoyed the renting phase as we go through various life transitions, there have been countless times where we wish we just owned the place where we lived. This is not a knock on renting, certain lifestyles, and life situations definitely cater more to the renter. We were traveling a lot for work, growing our family, moving states, and changing jobs; no way could we have been taking care of a homestead in the midst of all of those life changes. Renting has provided us flexibility, and the ability to wait for the right opportunity to move into home ownership.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Semi-Rural Home Internet</title><link>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/semi-rural-home-internet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.griffinsteffy.com/posts/semi-rural-home-internet/</guid><description>&lt;p>My family recently ended our time living in an apartment and found a home in a semi-rural area. I say semi-rural because we are surrounded by cornfields and country homes, but are 3 minutes from a business park, and 3 minutes form three different interstate exits. Unfortunately, even with the business development happening near out home, the residential infrastructure has not kept up. I work in the tech space, and to be short I am a power user of our home internet service. Whether it is video calls for work, streaming high quality videos, or other personal projects (this site included); I am constantly uploading and downloading from a server somewhere.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
