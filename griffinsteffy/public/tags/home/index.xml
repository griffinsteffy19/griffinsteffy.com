      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even though I switched to obsidian for my second brain, I still value Notion as a tool for organizing information. The true power of notion is in it&amp;rsquo;s database capabilities which is why it is a top choice for a lot of people&amp;rsquo;s second brain.&#xA;I still take advantage of Notion&amp;rsquo;s strength by creating a coffee database for all of the different beans and roasters that I have tried for about the last 2 years. This is something I used to do in an Apple Note, but it is much easier to maintain inside of a database.&#xA;I started out keeping track of different beans that I tried because someday I was going to forget what beans I had tried, and which ones I hav not. This then expanded into a rough ranking system so if I ever did want to try beans again, then I knew which ones were my favorites, and as time has continued I have kept adding metadata to each entry to provide as much useful information I&amp;rsquo;ll need regarding coffee beans.&#xA;Here is the link to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.notion.so/griffinsteffy/032fb06e7d594cc5a7c777cb1e88c8e8?v=59c9128356674ff08dd849e3a7cc4398&amp;amp;pvs=4&#34;&gt;coffee bean database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Watering Our Plant</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am not a plant expert, and I really have only sort of cared about taking care of them for almost a year, but as I was watered our birds of paradise tonight I figured that sharing my process is something that is worth sharing.&#xA;We got a birds of paradise plant last year for my wife&amp;rsquo;s birthday, and I saw &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; because it is technically her plant but I have taken over watering responsibilities since she has gotten too big for her to pick up on her own. Regardless the plant&amp;rsquo;s name is Gwen and we&amp;rsquo;re happy to have her in our home.&#xA;After doing a few google searches we learned that bottom feeding was the easiest and most effective way to promote health plant growth (along with sufficient sunlight). When the plant was small in its starter planter it was easy to lift it up into our kitchen sink and let her sit overnight. Since she has outgrown the sink we moved to the bathtub.&#xA;Our process is pretty simple&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Christmas Light Learnings</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a first time homeowner, I have never had the opportunity to decorate the outside of my own home for Christmas until now. I always loved helping my dad put up lights, but when you are a kid, you do not realize how much actually goes into a task that seems so simple. Not that the task is very difficult, but I did want to record a few things I learned, and lessons that I&amp;rsquo;ll take into next year when I go for round two.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Smart Home Starter Pack</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been slowly building out a smart home for almost 3 years now, but only in the last 9 months have I actually made some significant progress. I think back to how I started building out my system, and thinking to myself how I wish I had better spent my dollars. Below is my suggested start pack for those who are starting anew smart home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Smart thermostat&#xA;I would guess that a majority of people begin their smart home with one of two things, the main one being a smart thermostat. Not only is it super fun to control your home from miles away, but adding a smart thermostat can save you dollars on your utility bill. Also, in some areas your utility company will give you rebates or discounts that practically make the device free! A smart thermostat is a no brainer for any home owner in my opinion, regardless if you have ambitions to build the smart home any further.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Smart Lock&#xA;A smart lock probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be most people choice, but the reason I have it placed second is similar to the thermostat, the value a smart lock provides is much higher than most entry level items. Although they tend to be a bit pricy they give you more sense of security knowing that you can check if you locked the door when you are away from home, lock it if you didn&amp;rsquo;t, and then move on with your day. If you aspirations are to add one eventually, I would save up for a bit longer and skip all of the less expensive options initially and add much more value by adding a smart lock.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Smart Light Switch&#xA;This would probably not make most people list, but in lieu of not mentioning a smart light bulb, I think a smart light switch is much more valuable to a home than a single bulb. Typically updating a home to be smart comes with training of other house member. Smart lights are the  epitome of this by constantly trying to convince whoever it is not to turn off the lamp you have set on a timer. Although this is harmless, it can still be frustrating. Thus is why I believe a smart light switch is a better add to a starting smart home. There is no training, if they accidentally press the light switch, there is no loss of connection, just either a routine acceleration or deviation. Either of these are fine as they will be corrected at the next schedule turning point. Smart light switches are a great add to any home, allowing for soft exposure to the entire household to living in a smart home.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Building a smart home is not easy, and definitely not cheap. If I were to start over again I would first add the items that provide the most value per dollar, not necessarily the lowest dollar amount. Unfortunately, many go the later route and lose interest because they no longer see the benefit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Coffee Routine</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coffee comes as a forced taste to me, I actually couldn&amp;rsquo;t even take a sip of it until a little over three years ago. What I did enjoy was the scent and vibe that coffee carries with it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to turn into a latte lover though, so I set a requirement for myself that in order to start making coffee on a regular basis I was going to enjoy drinking it black. I did not realize that this requirement I set for myself would then send me down a rabbit hole on how to make great tasting black cups of coffee in the morning versus the typical drip or pod machines. I started the journey using a French Press, moved quickly to an AeroPress for a whole year, and then finally moved to a chemex and have been there ever since. I still enjoy using the other tools, you can make great coffee out of almost anything actually, but I feel like I have settled down to a morning routine that I don&amp;rsquo;t see making drastic changes to for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Making Small Changes</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/making-small-changes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Buying a house can be simplified to a single transaction of an asset; I never viewed it that way, but my expectations for how I would be emotionally effected were not even close. My prediction was that I would be elated to move into my families first home together, and even though there would be challenges I would be so happy to be there that I would not let those challenges phase me. I still had those elated feelings, sometimes I still feel like my life isn&amp;rsquo;t real, but I seemed to be more sunk into reality that I know have a lot more responsibility than I have ever had before.&#xA;I did not prepare myself for the emotional toll that these new responsibilities would weigh on my mind. Since we have moved in I feel like my creativity has been at an all time low since starting this project. I find my self coming up wit titles, but nothing more ever comes from those ideas zipping past me. On top of that, we haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to make many changes to the place, because we are just trying to figure it out as we go, so we have yet to put our stamp on the place.&#xA;I can go on and on about how I feel like I am now on the way up mentally from this home purchasing experience, but what started it all was beginning to make our home feel like it is ours. We have been holding back on making and major cosmetic changes for the first month or two to make sure our finances are in order. I believe that regardless of what stress I have now, adding some financial stress on top of it cannot make it better. Knowing that, we still decided that it was time to paint (we might have been pushed a little after we discovered that there was a 40% off sale). Paint seemed like one of the least expensive changes we could make, and we want to do it anyway so no long term loss if it didn&amp;rsquo;t make a difference.&#xA;After painting our bedroom, I can assure you that I feel much better about sleeping in there at night, purely by how I feel when I walk in the room. I can only describe it as putting our mark on the home, and no longer are we living in someone else&amp;rsquo;s space. All it took was a few gallons of paint, and for us to borrow some paint supplies from our family to turn things around. We didn&amp;rsquo;t eliminate any problems, all we did was give the walls a facelift and it has kicked us off in the right direction.&#xA;All of a sudden I can feel my creative flow coming back, and am more motivated to keep pressing towards my goals that I have laid out before. This experience has me thinking, I wonder what other small changes I can make in other areas of my life that could have a  larger impact than what they would cost me. Often it is the smallest changes that make the biggest difference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Right Opportunity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our Family just recently got an accepted offer on a house, and we are every excited to move into that next phase of life. Owning some property is something that we have had in the back of our minds since we have been married. Even though we have enjoyed the renting phase as we go through various life transitions, there have been countless times where we wish we just owned the place where we lived. This is not a knock on renting, certain lifestyles, and life situations definitely cater more to the renter. We were traveling a lot for work, growing our family, moving states, and changing jobs; no way could we have been taking care of a homestead in the midst of all of those life changes. Renting has provided us flexibility, and the ability to wait for the right opportunity to move into home ownership.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Semi-Rural Home Internet</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My family recently ended our time living in an apartment and found a home in a semi-rural area. I say semi-rural because we are surrounded by cornfields and country homes, but are 3 minutes from a business park, and 3 minutes form three different interstate exits. Unfortunately, even with the business development happening near out home, the residential infrastructure has not kept up. I work in the tech space, and to be short I am a power user of our home internet service. Whether it is video calls for work, streaming high quality videos, or other personal projects (this site included); I am constantly uploading and downloading from a server somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
