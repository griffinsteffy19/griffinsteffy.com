      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-ton-of-bricks&#34;&gt;A Ton of Bricks&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was very naive as a college graduate when it came to my finances. I generally knew how to save money, be frugal with my spending, but my actual my applicable knowledge of finances was novice at best. Having just graduated from a prestigious engineer school, I had accepted my first real job, was moving to another state, and was prepping to get married that summer, life was great. It wasn’t that I didn’t know what was coming my way, I just did not understand the gap of knowledge that I had to make up. The good news was that I had time on my side to figure things out before they really became a problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
