      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is typical this time of year for everyone to share things that they are thankful for having in their lives. I typically do not like to follow trends, but when I was listing out my top handful I noticed that a majority of them started with the same letter. Since I found that comical, I decided to share it here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Family&#xA;I think this could go without an explanation, but regardless I&amp;rsquo;ll give a brief one. Since moving back home closer to family I really have noticed a big difference in my life. I am more willing to ask for help, and actually enjoy spending time with my family much more than years past. This is going to be the first holiday season where I am no longer traveling to see people for the holidays, and I&amp;rsquo;ll get to sleep in my own bed the same night we get together. I believe being able to chose to spend time with family, instead of being forced to has made a huge difference.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Friends&#xA;Ever since college the time I get to spend with my friends has dwindled dramatically. This is mostly because we are scattered throughout the nation (and world currently), but it has forced me to reflect on how much I need to enjoy the time I do get with my friends. I&amp;rsquo;m thankful for the time we have gotten to spend together, even though it is few and far between as of recent.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fitness&#xA;After moving into our house, I had a realization why it is so important to maintain my fitness. I am not sure how people move furniture around the way we did without some sort of physical training. It definitely was not easy, but we leaned hard on my and my families physical fitness to move tons of furniture up and down stairs. Looking forward to what I have in store for my life, I am glad that I maintain a level of fitness that will allow me to continue to do hard things.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Football&#xA;Purely for entertainment, the sport of Football has brought me tons of joy in the past two years. My family has been through countless changes, and when I get the chance to sit down on the couch and watch a game, or turn it on in the background, I truly enjoy every minute I get to watch of America&amp;rsquo;s game.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Freedom&#xA;Living in a country where we have the freedom that we have is a blessing. I know I take it for granted every day, and only if I were in the other situation would I know just how good we have it over here in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <title>How I Use Todoist</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my original outline of my Second Brain I briefly described how I store my tasks. Since then, I have had time to get through a few iterations of my workflow using this specific application.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Luckily my favorite things that drew me to the app initially are all still true, and most likely even more reinforced. It is quick to add task, organize them, and complete them as they come up. The cross-platform availability is what really gets me excited about talking about &lt;a href=&#34;https://todoist.com/&#34;&gt;Todoist&lt;/a&gt;. I have mentioned that my work computer is a Windows machine, and I would like to use arguably the most crucial part of my second brain the 40+ hours a week I am using my work computer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cramping Expectations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have never been a heavy user of social media, but I noticed about a month ago that I was starting to spend more time than usual scrolling. Having an iPhone, I actually have had a time limit setup for over a year, but have ignored it almost every time.&#xA;After I noticed that my mindless scrolling was starting to take away from doing things that I enjoy, and bring me happiness I decided to just delete all social media from my phone. It helps that I talk to all of my friends in dedicated messaging apps, so I did not lose any meaningful connections of mine by making this change.&#xA;Not only was it taking up time I could use better elsewhere, social media has this effect to limit expectations in life. It is great to look up to others, but through the phone screen I end up setting my expectations to what everyone else has accomplished. My work becomes limited by what others have done, and not by what my own mind can create.&#xA;I have struggled the last few months to get content up on this website. Even with potentially the lowest barrier to entry for uploading content, I still feel like I am fishing for ideas on a weekly basis. Since making this change it has gotten slightly better, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure that years of limiting my expectations, while also trying to be somewhat creative are two forces fighting against each other.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t see myself adding back any of the social media apps anytime soon. They were making too big of an impact on what I want to accomplish, hoping that my creativity begins to flourish without having an established ceiling on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working as an embedded developer I do acknowledge that I have a lot of luxuries. I am blessed to have a great job, work for a great company who cares about its employees, and have the freedom to express myself through what I wear to work.&#xA;I have not been in the working world as long as others, but in my short time, I have discovered a few things that I enjoy wearing to maintain productivity and comfortability throughout the work day. Here are the three things I wear to the office almost every day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The State of My Second Brain</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I first discovered the concept of a second brain in the late spring, as I was in the middle of organizing my life. I was dealing with files, tasks, events, and projects that I was thinking about starting. To be honest I wasnâ€™t that disorganized beforehand, but what I was looking for was a structure to follow when new projects or ideas come up. I found that when a new idea would pop in my head, I scrambled to find the best place to at least record that idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Switched to Obsidian</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost 3 months I gave a comprehensive explanation of [[4 Notes/Blog Posts/The State of My Second Brain]], or personal knowledge management system (PKM). At the time I was using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.notion.so&#34;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt; as the heart of everything, but I quickly ran into some of its limitations shortly after that content went live.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I found the most frustrating about Notion, was the need for a internet connection to access your entire workspace. This is not new information, it is one of the biggest complaints about the tool, but in my mind I did not think that I would ever run into this, because we live in 2022. I then realized how often I was inside of large auditoriums where I typically like to take notes (ie. Church, conferences, etc.) and there I didn&amp;rsquo;t have connection to view the entire workspace I had built for over a month. Notion does cache recent and frequent pages that you open, but the whole idea of a PKM is that you can access your whole library, not just what you could access in your first brain (recent and frequent).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our Family just recently got an accepted offer on a house, and we are every excited to move into that next phase of life. Owning some property is something that we have had in the back of our minds since we have been married. Even though we have enjoyed the renting phase as we go through various life transitions, there have been countless times where we wish we just owned the place where we lived. This is not a knock on renting, certain lifestyles, and life situations definitely cater more to the renter. We were traveling a lot for work, growing our family, moving states, and changing jobs; no way could we have been taking care of a homestead in the midst of all of those life changes. Renting has provided us flexibility, and the ability to wait for the right opportunity to move into home ownership.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I&#39;ve Read the Bible 838 Times</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/ive-read-the-bible-838-times/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On January 1st, 2020 I set a goal in my mind to read the entire Bible that year. My goal was to read a piece of it every day, and by the end of the year, I will have read the entire book cover to cover (essentially).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a few days I rediscovered the &lt;a href=&#34;https://oneyearbibleonline.com&#34;&gt;The One Year Bible&lt;/a&gt;, which provided more of a structure to my reading plan. This allowed me to offload the mental process of deciding how much I should read that day, and just focus on reading. The obvious benefit here was saving time, but it also allowed me to focus more on the content and not constantly looking for my next stopping point as I read. 838 Days in and I am by no means an expert on the Bible, I have just read through it a few times, but since starting this habit I have learned 3 key lessonsâ€¦&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Ton of Bricks</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-ton-of-bricks&#34;&gt;A Ton of Bricks&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was very naive as a college graduate when it came to my finances. I generally knew how to save money, be frugal with my spending, but my actual my applicable knowledge of finances was novice at best. Having just graduated from a prestigious engineer school, I had accepted my first real job, was moving to another state, and was prepping to get married that summer, life was great. It wasnâ€™t that I didnâ€™t know what was coming my way, I just did not understand the gap of knowledge that I had to make up. The good news was that I had time on my side to figure things out before they really became a problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
