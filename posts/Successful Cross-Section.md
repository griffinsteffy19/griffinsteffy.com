I was listening to the latest episode of the [Matti Haapoja Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yiukwi_3n_A) and the discussion came up around the relationship between an obsession and skill. 
In their conversation they were discussing a successful career and ways that someone can achieve it. Essentially it is where an obsession and skill align, but finding that middle ground tends to be the tough part.
For myself, I know specific things that I am skilled at, and others that I am currently obsessing over. I'm currently in the hunt for finding an area where the two overlap but have not found the silver bullet yet.
Matti was already a great film maker, and he became obsessed with making a business to teach people. Out of that combination has grown a very successful YouTube channel, and many other related businesses.
I hope someday I find the cross-section of obsession and skill, and when I do, I'll be sure to reflect back to this moment when I feel like I will never get there.
