description: I enjoy trying new coffee beans each time I order a bag, I wanted to keep track of which beans I had tried in order to not repeat, but I ended up creating a database to hold more information than that.

Even though I switched to obsidian for my second brain, I still value Notion as a tool for organizing information. The true power of notion is in it's database capabilities which is why it is a top choice for a lot of people's second brain.
I still take advantage of Notion's strength by creating a coffee database for all of the different beans and roasters that I have tried for about the last 2 years. This is something I used to do in an Apple Note, but it is much easier to maintain inside of a database.
I started out keeping track of different beans that I tried because someday I was going to forget what beans I had tried, and which ones I hav not. This then expanded into a rough ranking system so if I ever did want to try beans again, then I knew which ones were my favorites, and as time has continued I have kept adding metadata to each entry to provide as much useful information I'll need regarding coffee beans.
Here is the link to my [coffee bean database](https://www.notion.so/griffinsteffy/032fb06e7d594cc5a7c777cb1e88c8e8?v=59c9128356674ff08dd849e3a7cc4398&pvs=4).
