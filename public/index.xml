My goal was to read a piece of it every day, and by the end of the year, I will have read the entire book cover to cover (essentially).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a few days I rediscovered the &lt;a href="https://oneyearbibleonline.com">The One Year Bible&lt;/a>, which provided more of a structure to my reading plan. This allowed me to offload the mental process of deciding how much I should read that day, and just focus on reading. The obvious benefit here was saving time, but it also allowed me to focus more on the content and not constantly looking for my next stopping point as I read. 838 Days in and I am by no means an expert on the Bible, I have just read through it a few times, but since starting this habit I have learned 3 key lessons…&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Test Full Pipeline Post</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/testing-again/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/testing-again/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="test-header">Test Header&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>I was very naive as a college graduate when it came to my finances. I generally knew how to save money, be frugal with my spending, but my actual my applicable knowledge of finances was novice at best. Having just graduated from a prestigious engineer school, I had accepted my first real job, was moving to another state, and was prepping to get married that summer, life was great. It wasn’t that I didn’t know what was coming my way, I just did not understand the gap of knowledge that I had to make up. The good news was that I had time on my side to figure things out before they really became a problem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First YouTube Video</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/first-youtube-video/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/first-youtube-video/</guid><description>&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;p>If there is one thing you should know about me is that I am not a confident writer. As I wrote papers during school, I tended to procrastinate (maybe like yourself). However, I’m not sure I always waited till the last minute due to a lack of an idea. Sometimes it was no motivation to write, but looking back I do not think that was always the case.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>FFP (Fastest Feasible Product)</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/ffp-fastest-feasible-product/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/ffp-fastest-feasible-product/</guid><description>&lt;p>The hurdle of perfection is one of the hardest to get over when it comes to starting a project. I wonder how many projects I failed to start, because the ideal ending seemed like too daunting of a task. It sounds easy to take one step at a time, but when the main focus is perfection the road will never end, and taking a small step seems like a drop in the ocean.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>http://localhost:1313/index-about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/index-about/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="welcome-to-the-blog">Welcome to the Blog&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Awhile back I started a blog, but the path I chose caused a lot of friction from the idea creating to the publishing. Hopefully this one is setup better where I can update things here with minimal effort in the publishing phase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully over the next couple of weeks I can work on converting my older posts to this version so I can create a nice backlog.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
