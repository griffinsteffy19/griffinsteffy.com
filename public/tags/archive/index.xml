&lt;p>I was very naive as a college graduate when it came to my finances. I generally knew how to save money, be frugal with my spending, but my actual my applicable knowledge of finances was novice at best. Having just graduated from a prestigious engineer school, I had accepted my first real job, was moving to another state, and was prepping to get married that summer, life was great. It wasn’t that I didn’t know what was coming my way, I just did not understand the gap of knowledge that I had to make up. The good news was that I had time on my side to figure things out before they really became a problem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Purpose</title><link>https://gokarna-hugo.netlify.app/posts/purpose/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gokarna-hugo.netlify.app/posts/purpose/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-idea-behind-it">The Idea Behind It&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If there is one thing you should know about me is that I am not a confident writer. As I wrote papers during school, I tended to procrastinate (maybe like yourself). However, I’m not sure I always waited till the last minute due to a lack of an idea. Sometimes it was no motivation to write, but looking back I do not think that was always the case.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
