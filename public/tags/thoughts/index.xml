&lt;li>What would you do if you had financial freedom?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What does it look like to discover and pursue God&amp;rsquo;s Calling?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are some tools I can immediately use to better discover my calling?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can I integrate my faith into my everyday work?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Where does something cross from being too hard to learn into not worth your time to pursue?&lt;/li>

In their conversation they were discussing a successful career and ways that someone can achieve it. Essentially it is where an obsession and skill align, but finding that middle ground tends to be the tough part.
For myself, I know specific things that I am skilled at, and others that I am currently obsessing over. I&amp;rsquo;m currently in the hunt for finding an area where the two overlap but have not found the silver bullet yet.
Matti was already a great film maker, and he became obsessed with making a business to teach people. Out of that combination has grown a very successful YouTube channel, and many other related businesses.
I hope someday I find the cross-section of obsession and skill, and when I do, I&amp;rsquo;ll be sure to reflect back to this moment when I feel like I will never get there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>FFP (Fastest Feasible Product)</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/ffp-fastest-feasible-product/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/ffp-fastest-feasible-product/</guid><description>&lt;p>The hurdle of perfection is one of the hardest to get over when it comes to starting a project. I wonder how many projects I failed to start, because the ideal ending seemed like too daunting of a task. It sounds easy to take one step at a time, but when the main focus is perfection the road will never end, and taking a small step seems like a drop in the ocean.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Purpose</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/purpose/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/purpose/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-idea-behind-it">The Idea Behind It&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If there is one thing you should know about me is that I am not a confident writer. As I wrote papers during school, I tended to procrastinate (maybe like yourself). However, Iâ€™m not sure I always waited till the last minute due to a lack of an idea. Sometimes it was no motivation to write, but looking back I do not think that was always the case.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
